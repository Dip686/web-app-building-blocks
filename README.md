# web-app-building-blocks

Created with the AIM of making web app building easier and helping anyone to learn how to build a particular feature that could be anything or everything associated with building a website. It contains packages with these features being implemented in isolation. These are reusable and loosely coupled. That means each package contains only a particular feature or related features implemented.
